# Object Oriented Programming: End Semester Project
## Muslim Minder Android Application
### Description
This android app is developed to inculcate some of the most important requirements on a day-to-day basis of a Muslim. This application goes beyond simply providing prayer timings; it comes out to be a comprehensive and user-friendly resource 
for daily Islamic practice.

The application offers a location-based prayer time notification system, ensuring users remain aware of their salat obligations regardless of their whereabouts. Recognizing the importance of supplication in various situations, the application 
also features a selection of duas categorized by emotions and circumstances. This allows users to find appropriate prayers for moments of joy, gratitude, anxiety, or any other emotional state they encounter.

Furthermore, the application will integrate a tasbih counter, facilitating the act of dhikr (remembrance of Allah) throughout the day. Users can utilize this feature to silently count their supplications and strengthen their spiritual 
connection. Finally, the application will display the 99 Names of Allah (SWT), allowing users to explore their meanings and gain a deeper understanding of the divine attributes.

This application is designed to be a valuable tool for Muslims seeking to integrate their faith seamlessly into their daily lives. Through its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features, the application aims to support users in 
fulfilling their religious obligations and fostering a deeper connection with Allah (SWT).

The application uses the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming to function. In our effort to keep the app as accessible as possible, we used an SQLite database which is stored locally on the users device for quick and easy access to the 
supplications without any need of an internet connection. However, to get accurate and reliable prayer times, an internet connection is required. This was done because the calculation of these times is done by professional theologians and we 
intended only to provide the user that information easily. Furthermore, various schools of thought have different methods for calculating prayer times. We used the [ MuslimSalat API ]( https://muslimsalat.com/ ) for retrieving and displaying 
the prayer times.
